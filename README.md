# NBA Player Performance Analysis & MVP Prediction 

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data science project that analyzes 10 years of NBA player statistics (Regular Season & Playoffs). The project spans from automated data collection (web scraping) and feature engineering to statistical correlation analysis and Machine Learning-based MVP prediction. 

**Timeframe analyzed:** 2014-15 to 2024-25 NBA Seasons.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Collection:** `requests`, RESTful APIs
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (Random Forest Classifier)

## Project Structure
* `NBA_DA_report.ipynb`: **[⭐ Start Here]** A comprehensive executive summary detailing the project's background, analytical methodologies, and key basketball/business insights.
* `NBA_DA.ipynb`: The automated web scraping notebook demonstrating the data collection pipeline from NBA.com.
* `NBA_DA_2.ipynb`: The core analytical notebook featuring Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical visualizations, and the Random Forest MVP prediction model.
* `nba_player_data.xlsx`: The raw dataset generated by the scraping script.

##  Key Features & Methodologies

### 1. Automated Data Pipeline
* Built a custom Python scraper to bypass standard API limitations, incorporating specific headers to reliably pull 10 seasons of data directly from `stats.nba.com`.

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
* Calculated advanced basketball metrics beyond traditional box scores, including:
  * **True Shooting Percentage (TS%)**
  * **Assist-to-Turnover Ratio (AST/TOV)**
  * **Points per Field Goal Attempt (PTS/FGA)**
* Standardized stats to "Per Minute" to accurately evaluate player efficiency regardless of playing time.

### 3. Statistical Analysis & Visualization
* Conducted correlation analysis to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) driving player success.
* Developed correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to uncover the relationship between advanced metrics and actual on-court impact.

### 4. Machine Learning MVP Predictor 
* Engineered a target variable labeling historical MVPs (e.g., Jokic, Antetokounmpo, Embiid, Curry).
* Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** utilizing core metrics (PPG, APG, RPG) to predict the likelihood of a player winning the MVP award in subsequent seasons.
* Utilized techniques like `class_weight='balanced'` to handle the extreme class imbalance (only one MVP per year) and evaluated the model using training/testing accuracy splits.

## How to Review
Since this project was developed and documented in Jupyter Notebooks, the most straightforward way to review the insights is directly through GitHub's native rendering—no local setup required:
1. **For a high-level overview:** Open `NBA_DA_report.ipynb` to read the full analytical story.
2. **For the technical data pipeline:** Check `NBA_DA.ipynb`.
3. **For EDA & Machine Learning details:** Dive into `NBA_DA_2.ipynb`.

*(Optional) To run this project locally, clone the repository, install the required packages (`pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, requests`), and execute the notebooks sequentially.*
